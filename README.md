Instructions:

    In Intellij, go to File > Open, and then select the folder Assignment3Part1

    First you need to import the library from https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/ (download latest version), or you could use the postgresql-42.7.3.jar file that I have included.

    Then in Intellij, go to File > Project Structure
    
    Got to Libraries, click the add and button and select the downloaded JDBC file (or the .jar file I included)

Execution:

    The Java class file is under src/Main.java

    Set your username and password for String user and String password (line 7 and 8)
    
    The 4 functions can be called within the if(conn != null) block, which I have also included the examples I used during my demo video
    
    All 4 functions are below the main function

    Click Run (Green triangle to right) in Main.java in Intellij to run the code

In PgAdmin:

    Database must be called Students

    I have included the initial setup query SQL code in the SQL.txt file
